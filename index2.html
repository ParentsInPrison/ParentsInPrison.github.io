<h1>The Arrest</h1>
<h3>The Beginning</h3>
  <img src="arrested.html" width="350px" alt="hands in handcuffs"><p> Imagine you're in your house, and all of a sudden the door slams open and several police barge in. They walk up to your dad, turn him around, shackle him in handcuffs, and announce that he is under arrest. The whole interaction is quick and simple and in minutes your loved one is gone. For anyone this experience is scary and in most cases, you don't understand why it is happening. The process is so quick, you don't even have enough time to fully register what's going on. This happens more often then you might think. In fact, although the U.S. only makes up <i>5%</i> of the <i>world</i> population, we house <i>25%</i> of the world <i>prison</i> population. The U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics states that there are currently 2,220,300 people incarcerated in the U.S. alone.  </p>

<h3>Your Rights</h3>
<p>An arrest has many steps, the first of which is shown above. The second step is when the police read you your rights. This is something that is required no matter the circumstances so as to protect your 5th Ammendment right to be free from self-incrimination. Your rights are as follows:
<ol class="olsize">
<li>You have the right to remain silent and to refuse to answer questions.</li>
<li>Anything you say may be used against you in a court of law.</li>
<li>You have the right to consult an attorney before speaking to the police and to have an attorney present during questioning now or in the future.</li>
<li>If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you before any questioning if you wish.</li>
<li>If you decide to answer questions now without an attorney present, you will still have the right to stop answering at any time until you talk to an attorney.</li></ol></p>
<h3>The Search</h3>
<p>Once arrested, the police will most likely search both you and your surroundings for evidence of a crime. The police will then perform an inventory and have the right to abtain and secure any personal property they see fit. They will ask you to sign the inventory, but you don't have to sign if you disagree with the contents. </p> 
<h3>Being Booked</h3>
<p>After the inverntory is complete, you will be booked. What this means is the police will ask you for your basic information such as your birthdate, eye color, hair color, etc. They will take your fingerprint and a photograph of you, and possibly even a handwriting sample.</p>
