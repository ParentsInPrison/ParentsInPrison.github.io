<h1>Going to Court</h1>
<h5>Process varies in different states</h5>
<h3>The Attorney</h3>
<p>Before you even have an officcial trial, some people will have an extra trial to decide their attorney. This process is what determins whether or not you qualify for a public attorney. If you cannot afford a private attorney, you may qualify for a public one. The issue with this is that public attornies is that in most cases, they are assigned to many people at the same time, rendering them unable to put their full efforts into your case. </p>
<h3>The Trial</h3>
<p>The problem with the actual trial is that for some people it is non existent for many years. Not to mention, a judge can't see the reasons for what you did, all they see is the person in front of them. Maybe you have a mental illness or you were abbused as a child and when sentenced, this problems are not fixed, rather you lose several rights such as right to vote. </p>
